# Road-Traffic-Signal
This project designs a traffic light circuit using a 555 timer IC in astable mode. It generates oscillations to control Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs, mimicking real traffic signals. The project introduces concepts of astable multivibrators, timing circuits, and LED control, serving as a hands-on electronics learning tool.
