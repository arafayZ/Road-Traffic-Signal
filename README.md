🚦 Traffic Light Circuit using 555 Timer

This project demonstrates the design of a traffic light system using the 555 timer IC in astable mode. The circuit sequentially controls Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs to replicate real-world traffic lights.

✨ Features

⏱ 555 Timer in Astable Mode – generates oscillating signals

🚦 LED Control – Red, Yellow, Green LEDs light up in sequence

🔄 Traffic Simulation – replicates real traffic light operation

📚 Educational Value – practical intro to multivibrators & timing circuits

🛠 Components Used

555 Timer IC

Red, Yellow, Green LEDs

Resistors & Capacitors (for timing control)

Power Supply (5V–12V)

Breadboard / PCB & wires

📌 Working Principle

The 555 timer is configured as an astable multivibrator.

It produces oscillations that switch LEDs ON and OFF at fixed intervals.

Adjusting resistor/capacitor values changes the timing of each light.

🚀 Applications

Educational training in electronics

Mini-project for students

Foundation for advanced traffic control circuits

📖 Conclusion

This project provides a simple yet effective introduction to electronics and circuit design, showcasing how basic components like the 555 timer IC can simulate real-world systems.
